        This document describes the Web Currency spec, which is about a single tag [currency] which marks up any price, monetary value, which allows the browser to provide on the fly currency conversation. This will help users to be able to on the fly see what a certain product with a price tagged inside a currency tag will cost in his local currency through exchange rate.

        You need to have a custom SotD paragraph. Maybe give a succinct description of your spec's
        status.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        E-commerce is today an international business. Customers buys goods and services from all over the world, and getting to know what a particular product will cost in his local exchange rate is not an easy task.
        Our draft is proposing a tag called currency which web authors can mark up the specific price tag, which then browsers can allow direct conversation exchange in a preferred or selected currency rate of the user.

          <h2>The <a href="#money">money</a> tag</h2>
          <p>The <a href="#money">&lt;money></a> tag is an inline tag that could wrap a fixed price inside, with an attribute specifying the original currency.
            <p class="ednote" title="Note about formatting">
            It is important to NOT include any currency symbol in the text because the value will be parsed as a decimal upon reading, and the browser should format the value according to the currency.
            <p>
            <div class="example">
              An example of how the currency tag could work
              <pre class="highlight">
                &lt;div>
                  &lt;h2>Product info&lt;/h2>

                    &lt;dt>Price&lt;/dt>

                &lt;p>
                I would really recommend this product which cost &lt;money currency="usd">50.0&lt;/money> 
                because of it's great functionality. In addition, you can also find a cheaper version of the product for &lt;currency money="usd">20.0&lt;/money> 
                if you don't need the more advanced features&lt;/p>
